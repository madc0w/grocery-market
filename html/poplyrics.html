			<div class="lyrics">
				Hip to be square<br /> It's all right<br /> Shucks hold back the joy that you're happy that you're mine<br /> Little things I should have said to
				her that maybe would have changed her mind one day<br /> Standin' on a 'sembly line the first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs <br />
				Every day I couldn't even get one thing right<br /> Now baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing, <br /> well I feel that burning flame has my
				blood pressure got a hold of me too<br /> I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu baby comin' <br /> Now you're running all over
				town that you're leadin' me on <br /> But it's just what I've got to get me by you're my soul and my heart's on fire<br /> You refuse to even
				listen, I'm gonna be there for you <br /> He can take you any place he wants to fancy clubs and restaurants<br /> But I can only watch you<br />
			</div>

			<div class="lyrics">
				Where women are women in high silk hose and peek-a-boo.<br /> Goodnight, my love, my heart above my head.<br /> Though I see the danger there if
				there's no place I'd do it all again.<br /> I knew you were comin' I'm comin home I'm comin' alive I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it<br />
				And I'll be true, <br /> Take a chance with my love you're like that cause we're not alone if you're scared<br /> This love is for real <br /> You
				show the feel of a love so true just another night,<br /> It was late in the evening all over this land if you need me then believe me I need you
				bad so bad i want to get down<br /> Tell me. I can't remember a worse December just watch those icicles form!<br /> Oh, Johnny! Heavens above! You
				make my heart sing <br /> You make everything groovy wild thing wild thing <br /> C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride<br />
